/* chapter 2
 * (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. 
 * Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, 
 * so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, 
 * which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and 
 * reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following 
 * information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:

Total miles driven per day.

Cost per gallon of gasoline.

Average miles per gallon.

Parking fees per day.

Tolls per day.
